    \section{Projects}
    \subsection{EEG Controlled Prostetic}
    Used Python to develop software that can control a 3D printed prosthetic by reading real-time brain data. 
    The software mimics an EEG brain-reading device and outputs the data similarly to what an EEG device would. 
    The other part of the software reads in the data with the help of Sockets; 
    the software then processes it into a graph using Matplotlib.
