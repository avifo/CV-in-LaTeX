# CV-in-LaTeX
My CV written in LaTeX
I wanted to learn LaTeX as I find the documents made in it very nice, so I re-wrote my CV as a small exercise to understand how the language works. As a slight challenge, I wanted all the content on one page and divided between 2 columns.  

You can view the CV in the CV.PDF file within the repository.
